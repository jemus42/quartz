## What is this

It's [Quartz], which basically takes an [Obsidian] vault and wraps [hugo] around it.
So.. yeah.

Yet another second brain thing.
Because I don't have enough half-filled auxilliary brains lying around already.
But here goes.


## What will this be

Idunno yet.
Maybe something about [[notes/tools/starship]], or [[notes/programming/Rust]], or #tools ?
At this point I'm just making links to stuff for the link's sake, just to see how it's rendered.
