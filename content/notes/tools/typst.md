A [[notes/programming/Rust]]-based [[LaTeX]]-alternative in the very early stages as of March 2023.
It looks really promising though, and [[pandoc]] has support for it as of [version 3.1.2](30. Mar 2023). So it's only a matter of time until we can go from [[Rmarkdown]] or [[Quarto]] to PDF _without LaTeX_. That would be amazing.
