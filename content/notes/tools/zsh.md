A neat [[notes/programming/Shell Scripting]]. 
As far as I remember not quite [[POSIX]]-compliant like [[bash]] and therefore(?) not as portable, but a lot nicer.
To be honest, not as nioce as [[fish]] though, but that one, nice as it is, has a somewhat different syntax, making it not only less portable, but also hard for muscle-memory-riddled ol' me.

## Setup

- oh-my-zsh
- autosuggestions
- syntax-highlighting
- prompt
	- [[notes/tools/starship]]
	- p9k -> p10k
